          Hi, I'm Hammad Bin Tayyab, I'm a resident of a beautiful city of India
          called Lucknow where I've spent most of my life till now
          <br />
          <br />. I've completed my intermeidates from S.T. Fidelis College and
          currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Applications at Integral
          University, Lucknow. I love designing and creating!
          <br />
          <br />
          I've previously worked on a variety of projects, from designing
          commercial projects to building entire applications. You can find them
          all at the Home Section of my Portfolio. When I'm not designing or
          developing, you can find me exploring new things and enjoying life.
